"""Card storage.

Every method takes an ``owner`` key and every SQL statement filters on it. There is
no way to read, change or delete a card without naming its owner, so one user can
never reach another user's cards through this module.

Card numbers are per owner (each user's first card is #1) and are never reused
after a delete, so a number someone remembers can't silently point at a new card.

Topics are matched case-insensitively: each card stores the topic as typed, plus a
normalized ``topic_key`` used for filtering (see ``topic_key``).

Two stores behave the same way and run the same tests: ``SqliteCardStore`` for local
development, and ``PostgresCardStore`` for the hosted server, where the disk is wiped
on every restart.
