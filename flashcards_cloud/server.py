"""Hosted, multi-user flashcards MCP server.

Each signed-in user has their own deck. Identity comes from the verified access
token (see identity.py); storage is always scoped to that user (see store.py).

Limits exist because this runs on free-tier hosting with open sign-up: per-user
card count and total size, short text fields, paginated listing, and a per-user
rate limit, so one account can't exhaust memory, storage or the event loop.
